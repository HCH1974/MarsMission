1. Curiosity
Excluding its hazcams and navcams (but including the Mastcam), 
Curiosity carries 10 instruments to explore the martian environment. The roverâ€™s robotic arm also sports a drill and a scoop.

2. Preservence seeks signs of possible past microbial life in those habitable environments, particularly in special rocks known to preserve signs of life over time.

3. Spirit uncovered strong evidence that Mars was once much wetter than it is now.

4. Oppurtunity:
Opportunity and its twin Spirit were tasked with studying sites on Mars where conditions may once have been favorable for life.
Opportunity found evidence that Mars may once have been able to sustain microbial life.

5. Oppurtunity instruments:
The Rovers' instruments are state-of-the-art tools for acquiring information about Martian geology, atmosphere, environmental conditions, and potential biosignatures.

6. Curiosity has demonstrated the ability to land a very large, heavy rover to the surface of Mars and to land more precisely in a 12.4-mile (20-kilometer) landing area

7. Mars Olympus Mons: 
Olympus Mons, Mars' highest mountain, stands 25 km tall - two and a half times the height of Mount Everest.

8. Planet Mars entry from space: 
NASA engineers prepared intensively for over 45 days to guide Curiosity Rover through Mars' atmosphere and land successfully. 

9. Mars Jezero Crater: 
The Mars Perserverance rover touched down in the 45km wide Jezero Crater. The crater is thought to have once been filled with water - hence its name, which means "lake" in Czech.

10. The Planet Mars:
Civilisations throughout history have known Mars for its reddish colour, reminiscent of blood. The name Mars comes from the Ancient Roman God of War.
